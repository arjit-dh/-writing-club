# Writing Club Guidelines

## Introduction

You've been meaning to do it for so long. Now is the time. Treat yourself to some writing time.

## What is Writing Club?

Writing Club is a dedicated hour every week when you can push aside all your other responsibilities and just do some writing alongside other writing enthusiasts!

## How to Join

1. Visit the Slack channel titled [#writing-club](https://deliveryhero.slack.com/archives/C066PERHDBR).
2. Request a member to add you to the recurring calendar invite.
3. Decide on your participation cadenceâ€”weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.
4. Announce your commitment to your chosen cadence in the Slack channel.

## Rules

1. **No Guilt**: Fully commit to attending, or fully commit to doing something else with your hour.
2. **Library Rules**: Once we get started, no talking. Keep eating and drinking quiet and brief. Don't @-mention people in the room.

## Suggestions

1. **Plan Ahead**: Think about what you want to do with your hour before it begins.
2. **Avoid Distractions**: Writing is challenging. Your mind will reach for distractions. Turn off Slack, block Twitter, block Youtube, install Forest on your phone, do something - win the fight.
3. **Freedom of Topic**: You can write about whatever you like. 
4. **Share Your Work**: Share your work with the group for feedback in the Slack channel, if you are comfortable. It is exciting to see what everyone's working on!

## Ideas to Get You Started

1. Write for the person you were a year ago. What have you learnt?
2. If you've given the same advice three times, turn it into a blog post for folks to read.
